# Numerical Data types
# - Ints, long, float, comples
# THese are numerical data types which we can use numberical operators


# Complex and long number we don't use as much
# Complex bring an imaginary type of number
# Long - re integers of unlimited size
#
# int = Stands for integers
# Whole numbers
my_int  = 10
print(my_int)
print(type(my_int))

print(4/2) # Float
print(4//2) # Integer

# Comparission Operator
# == - Comparison Operator
#  </ > - Bigger and small than
# <= -Small than or equal
#  >= - bigger than or equel
#  != - Not equal
#  is and is not

variable1 = 10
variable2 = 13
print(variable1 == variable2)
print(variable1 > variable2)
print(variable1< variable2)

#Boolean Values
# Defined by whether True or not
print(type(True))
print(0 == False)
print(1 == True)

# None
print(None)
print(type(None))
print(bool(None))
print(0 == None)
print(False == None)

# Logical AND & OR

a = True
b = False
print(a and True)
