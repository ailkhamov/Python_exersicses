# Functions and Functional programming
# Functions are like a machine

# They take in arguments
# They have a block of code to run
# They output (return) something (optional)

#Running and Calling a fuction
# They need to be called to be executed

# Good practices
# following convention (lower case and seprated with _ underscore)
# good names (lower case and seperated with _ underscore)
# They should be atomic and small
    # They are testable
    # Reduces technical debt
# Comments when appropriate
# DO NOT PRINT IN FUNCTIONS

# Functions allow us to be DRY
# Don't repeat yourself

# Aim for Cleaner, Dryer and Testable
